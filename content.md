## IoT Protocols: MQTT, CoAP, HTTP & WebSockets

IoT is a buzzword. As a developer, I’m sure you’ve heard it many times - so many times that you probably tune it out as background noise at this point. Don’t let that phase you. IoT is nothing but a name for a set of ideas that you as developer should consider seriously. In this talk we'll take a practical - with demos - tour into application protocols for IoT.

### Outline of today's talk:

* MQTT
* CoAP
* HTTP
* WebSockets
* When **to use (or not!)** each of these protocols

------------------

## Bonus

* Adoption of these protocols in the **industrial world**
* Integration with existing fieldbuses
* And of course... **DEMOS!**

------------------

<!--TO REVIEW-->

## MQTT: Basics

**M**essage **Q**ueue **T**elemetry **T**ransport

_"Publish-subscribe-based "lightweight" messaging protocol, for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol."_

* Standard: ISO/IEC PRF 20922
* Small code footprint
* Limited network bandwidth
* A **message broker** is required

# Get Tough: The Adoption of IoT Protocols in Industry

------------------

## What's a Fieldbus?

_"Industrial, digital bus used for real-time distributed control."_

* Standards?
* Bla bla bla

## _State of the art_: IO-Link

_"Quote that summarizes the protocol..."_

* Standards?
* Bla bla bla

## _State of the art_: OPC-UA

_"Quote that summarizes the protocol..."_

* **Not a protocol**, but a "unified architecture"
* Bla bla bla
