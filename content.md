## A Gentle Introduction to IoT Protocols: MQTT, CoAP, HTTP & WebSockets

IoT is a buzzword. As a developer, I’m sure you’ve heard it many times - so many times that you probably tune it out as background noise at this point. Don’t let that phase you. IoT is nothing but a name for a set of ideas that you as developer should consider seriously. In this talk we'll take a practical - with demos - tour into application protocols for IoT.

### What Would We Like to Cover Today?

* MQTT
* CoAP
* HTTP
* WebSockets

### Bonus

* When to use each of this protocols
* When **not to** use them
* Adoption of these protocols in the **industrial world**
* Demos!
