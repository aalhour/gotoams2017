## IoT Protocols: MQTT, CoAP, HTTP & WebSockets

IoT is a buzzword. As a developer, I’m sure you’ve heard it many times - so many times that you probably tune it out as background noise at this point. Don’t let that phase you. IoT is nothing but a name for a set of ideas that you as developer should consider seriously. In this talk we'll take a practical - with demos - tour into application protocols for IoT.

### What Would We Like to Cover Today?

* MQTT
* CoAP
* HTTP
* WebSockets
* When **to use (or not!)** each of these protocols

------------------

## Bonus

* Adoption of these protocols in the **industrial world**
* Integration with existing fieldbuses
* And of course... **DEMOS!**

------------------

## MQTT

_"Quote that summarizes the protocol..."_

* Standard: IEC 61158
* Bla bla bla

------------------

## CoAp

_"Quote that summarizes the protocol..."_

* Standard: IEC 61158
* Bla bla bla

------------------

## HTTP

_"Quote that summarizes the protocol..."_

* Standard: IEC 61158
* Bla bla bla

------------------

## WebSockets

_"Quote that summarizes the protocol..."_

* Standard: IEC 61158
* Bla bla bla

------------------

# Get Tough: The Adoption of IoT Protocols in Industry

------------------

## What's a Fieldbus?

_"Industrial, digital bus used for real-time distributed control."_

* Standards?
* Bla bla bla
