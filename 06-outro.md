## Conclusions

 * There are many type of networks.
 * The protocol to use **depends** on what part of **which** network you are.
 * **Opinionated** Cheatsheet:
   * MQTT: D2C or C2C.
   * CoAP: D2D.
   * HTTP/1.1: C2C.
   * HTTP/2: C2C &mdash; possibly D2C.
   * DDS: C2C &mdash; claims of D2C seem exagerated.
   * WebSockets: C2C.
 * Operational Technology (OT) will be around for a longtime. Deal with it.
 * No silver bullet.
