## Conclusions

* There are many type of networks
* The protocol to use **depends** on what part of **which** network you are
* **Opinionated** Cheatsheet:
	* MQTT: D2C or C2C
	* CoAP: D2D
	* HTTP/1.1: C2C
	* HTTP/2: C2C &mdash; possibly D2C
	* DDS: C2C & D2C &mdash; claims of D2D seem exagerated
	* WebSockets: C2C
* Operational Technology (OT) will be around for a long time
* No silver bullet
