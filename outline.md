# GOTO AMS 2017 conference presentation plans

## Introduction

Here is the list of demos we are considering for the presentation

 1. ESP8266/ESP 32 demos with MQTT and HTTP - basing it off the code
    for the [workshop](https://github.com/relayr/ESP8266_Lua).
 2. CoAP and 6LowPAN demos using the stuff
    [developed](https://github.com/relayr/workshop-6lowpan) by
    Christos for the meetup. Push the RPL demo like Christos did on
    the workshop.
 3. Try to find a way to do an HTTP/2 demo. We'll need to use some more
    powerful device than a Zolertia or ESP. Ideally an Intel Edison or
    Galileo.
 4. IOLink develop a demo aroun their HTTP interface to industrial
    protocols stuff.
 5. WebSockets use the ESP8266/ESP32 for the demo.
 
 ## TODO
 
  1. Develop the slides.
  2. Create worksheets for the demos. Ideally for the ESP based demos
     and also for the Zolertia board.
  3. Improve the code for MQTT on the ESP.
  4. Create the code for the HTTP/2 with the Edison/Galileo.
